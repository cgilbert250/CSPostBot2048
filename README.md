Code for my image posting twitter bot (https://twitter.com/Science2048)

Just a fun side project. This tool chooses a random image, and pairs it with a random computer science themed caption to make a randomly-generated "meme" of sorts. Inital idea taken from https://twitter.com/ShitpostBot5000. 

The bot posts to twitter using code taken from https://www.mattcrampton.com/blog/step_by_step_tutorial_to_post_to_twitter_using_python/ (Thanks for the great tutorial!)

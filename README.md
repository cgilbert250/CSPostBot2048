# CSPostBot2048
Code for my image generation tool for https://www.facebook.com/CSPostBot2048

Just a fun side project. This tool chooses a random image, and chooses a random caption from a list to append to that image.

The image generation code is in botImageTest.py. The code to post the image to the facebook page will be added later, once facebook's individual reviewer restriction is lifted, and I can start the bot posting again.

Alternatively, I may move the posts to Twitter instead, please check back for more updates.
